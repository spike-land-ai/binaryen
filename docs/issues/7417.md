## Description

Hi,

Running:

```shell-session
$ scripts/fuzz_opt.py
```

will work just fine, but:

```shell-session
$ cd scripts && ./fuzz_opt.py
```

will not because it expects the `bin/wasm-opt` file to be in the current directory.

I think you can use `--binaryen-bin` to set the bin dir, so it can find the tools if they aren't under `./bin/`.
