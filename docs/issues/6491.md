## Description

I'm using binary-c API. I need to read modules from arbitrary binaries and do some analysis on them, including analyzing their `data` sections.

I find `BinaryenCopyMemorySegmentData(BinaryenModuleRef module, const char* segmentName, char* buffer)`, but this requires `segmentName`, which I can't determine for an arbitrary binary. I don't find any API like `BinaryenGetMemorySegmentByIndex` or `BinaryenMemorySegmentGetName` just like those for functions.
