## Description

- When I add a name custom section the the start of a file, the error reads: `expected function name count (9) <= function count (0)`.
- Putting the name section after type section: `Memory section can not occur after Name section`
- Putting it after the memory section: `Global section can not occur after Name section`
- Putting it after the memory section: `Export section can not occur after Name section`
- Putting it after the memory section: `Start section can not occur after Name section`
- Putting it after the memory section: `Code section can not occur after Name section`

I feel like the error message should include straight away that a name section must appear after the code section.
