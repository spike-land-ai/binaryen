## Description

`wasm-opt` warns on not having an output file. That make sense as it avoids a common error, but also it is not an error itself as there are valid use cases for wasm-opt without writing output (`wasm-opt --metrics` for example).

Other tools atm neither warn nor error, but we should probably do one of the two.
