# #1603: Missing C API for inspecting Memory?

## Description

Currently, there is `BinaryenSetMemory` in C API, but we don't have something like `BinaryenGetMemory` which ideally would allow us to inspect the data segments of a module, given a deserialized `BinaryenModuleRef`.

Having such an interface allows a wasm-targeting compiler based on binaryen to perform a simple sanity check: deserialize the generated module, and check if the deserialized data segments match the ones we feed to binaryen but represented in another language.
