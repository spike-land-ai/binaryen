# #2573: "skipping debug location info" warning

## Description

That warning comes from binaryen here:

https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/44c3c2d4e71686d42b7eff8ab9c554f83a9fe71e/src/wasm/wasm-binary.cpp#L1575

I'm not sure what it does actually as it doesn't seem to actually skip it... but I'm also not sure if it's ok to just remove it.

We are encountering the exact same issue.

This will probably get removed eventually with source maps support, as DWARF is replacing that, and works now. Unless I'm forgetting something - @DanielHauschildt are you using source maps, and if so how?

We are using or better trying to use sourcemaps in a bigger C++ project that is compiled to wasm. Our current approach is to build with sourcemaps and then patching those and including the full sources in the wasm.map file. This kind of works for now but isn't that good. This works with "-g3" also and thus we could remove "-g4" flags which created those "skipping debug..." warnings for now. Currently, we are tryting to get dwarf to work with the newest emscripten version and newest chrome canary.

I see, thanks @DanielHauschildt 

Meanwhile we've removed this warning in https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/2855 , but the underlying source maps issue is not fixed. Ongoing work on DWARF is still in progress, and latest emscripten + canary is the best to try it as you said, but it isn't ready yet.
