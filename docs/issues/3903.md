I don't have a win32 machine but I tried to use [zig cc](https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html) to make builds for that. First time I'm trying it, and it looks almost magical in how easy it is to cross-compile (I built win32 from my linux64, only issues were minor cmake things), but without a machine to test on I can't be sure it worked. Though they seem right as best I can tell:
```
$ file wasm*
wasm-as:                  PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-ctor-eval:           PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-dis:                 PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-emscripten-finalize: PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-metadce:             PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-opt:                 PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-reduce:              PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-shell:               PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
wasm-split:               PE32 executable (console) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
```
I added them to this gist:

You can download the zip of that to get the files. Please let me know if they work!
