# #7301: [C API] Some BinaryenString* functions declared in binaryen-c.h without implementation

## Description

- BinaryenStringIterNext
- BinaryenStringIterMove
- BinaryenStringSliceIter
- BinaryenStringNewSetTry
- BinaryenStringWTF8Advance

My FFI tooling breaks on those. Looks like there's no implementation, just declaration. Am I missing some compilation flags?

I've tried to find related commits (in case they were removed), but GitHub search wasn't helpful

Those do appear to be missing implementations. Declarations were added in 0821cd10da but I guess those were forgotten. It would be good to add them now if someone has time.

Implementations of `BinaryenStringIterNext`, `BinaryenStringIterMove`, and `BinaryenStringSliceIter` were added in https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/commit/0821cd10da9ca81371688e132ed17164f23ea889, but for some reason they were later removed.

These would be good to add, but note that we now have a StringLifting pass. One can emit imported strings, then lift them into the String* instructions, so it is less important to emit String* instructions directly (in fact, most toolchains might prefer not to, since VMs don't support them).
