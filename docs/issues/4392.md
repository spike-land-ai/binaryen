This looks like an OOM. In a debug build I get
```
Fatal: error building module, std::bad_alloc (possibly invalid request for silly amounts of memory)
```

FWIW, this was assigned CVE-2021-46053 by Red Hat. It's still reproducible with 121:
```
$ wasm-ctor-eval ./POC5 
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
  what():  std::bad_alloc
Aborted (core dumped)
```

I checked and I still get the friendlier error (no crash) from [2 messages ago](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/4392#issuecomment-993683465). Here is the catch of `bad_alloc`:

I'm not sure why on some machines that catch might not happen. Perhaps the full stack trace could help.
