## Description

Inspired by [this issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/issues/4948)
```wat
drop (i32.load $addr, offset=0)
  ...
drop (i32.load $addr, offset=8)
  ...
drop (i32.load $addr, offset=16)
```

Could be reduced to:
```wat
drop (i32.load $addr, offset=16) ;; leave only single `load` with highest `offset`
```
