## Description

I wonder if it's worth having a method like `wasm.getOnlyMemory` that asserts that there is exactly one memory and returns is. Then finding all the places that need to be updated to handle multi-memory could be found by searching for uses of that method.

This sounds like a good idea to me. I think `getSingleMemory` would be perhaps a better name given existing `getSingle*` stuff we have. Also the method could be on `MemoryUtils`.
