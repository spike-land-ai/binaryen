# #7552: wasm-opt version on crates.io

## Description

Hi, I noticed that the latest version of wasm-opt as part of binaryen is 123, but the latest version on crates.io is 116: https://crates.io/crates/wasm-opt

`cargo install` is a convenient cross-platform way to install wasm-opt without downloading and building the binaryen source manually. Same thing counts for CI pipelines.

Are there plans to keep updating the package on crates.io, or is that publication method deprecated?

Looks like @brson (hi!) created that crate - @brson what are your plans there?

All evidence suggests I can't maintain it. Haven't decided what to do with it yet.
