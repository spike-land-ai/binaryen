# #3244: Optimize trampled data in MemoryPacking

## Description

Background: #3222 

We now check for trampled data, and avoid optimizing memory segments
when we see any trampling. However, we could optimize it, that is, when
something is trampled, we can not emit it in the first place.

This may help @TerrorJack 's codebase - @TerrorJack is there a simple
way perhaps to avoid emitting overlapping segments in your compiler?
(Asking in order to see how to prioritize this.)

Overlapping segments was a bug in Asterius and we just fixed it, along with a mandatory pass to check for overlaps :)
I think it's reasonable for `binaryen` to avoid dealing with trampled data at all in memory packing.

Good to know, thanks @TerrorJack !

Probably not high priority then, but still a good idea eventually, leaving open.
