## Description

I updated our spec test suite to up-to-date version in #2484, but there are numerous syntax that are not currently supported in Binaryen. So I triaged them into different categories and [added them to spec test `BLACKLIST`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/f2ba91b6340a8c3099ab6a48700c717cbd33599e/scripts/test/shared.py#L404-L465) in `shared.py`.

While it is not a goal of Binaryen to support every single syntax that are supported in the spec repo, it looks some of the unsupported syntax can be easily supported. And also there are files for which the reasons for failure are unknown, so they need triage.

I'd like to track the issue here. Help is welcome to fix any one of the issues listed there.

In the blacklist, 'stacky code' and 'binary module' wouldn't be easy to fix. Binaryen uses AST for the IR and currently does not support stacky code / notation, and Binaryen does not support binary modules for now. I think other things can be fixed.
