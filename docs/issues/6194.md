# #6194: Questions Related to the Validation of Raw Input Bytes in C API

## Description

Hi developers, I have a problem (or somewhat feature request) related to the C API. Given a raw bytes stream, I need to validate whether it is a valid wasm module or not. In current `binaryen-c.h` file, we have `BinaryenModuleRead` and `BinaryenModuleValidate` to parse raw bytes into a `BinaryenModule` and validate `BinaryenModule` respectively. 

However, for `BinaryenModuleRead`, it will exit the process if the input raw bytes are invalid, for `BinaryenModuleValidate` it will print error messages to the `stdout`/`stderr` and requires a `BinaryenModuleRef` as parameter, so I want to know if there is an API that takes raw bytes as input, returns 1 for valid and 0 for invalid, and does nothing else (just like the `WebAssembly.validate()` in JS-Wasm API) ?

Thanks in advance for any kind response.

Looks like there isn't such an API atm. I wouldn't be opposed to adding one if we find a good design for it.
