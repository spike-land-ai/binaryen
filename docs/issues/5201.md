# #5201: Provide a pkg-config file?

## Description

Could Binaryen produce a pkg-config file when it is built? I currently maintain a bespoke set of flags for various OS and build envs that need to be provided when including Binaryen in our Binaryen.ml bindings project and in the Grain executables, but OCaml has great support for loading all of those from pkg-config if the files exist. It'd be great if anyone writing bindings for Binaryen could just rely on the pkg-config metadata.

Looks like this would involve reading and understanding the pkg-config [documentation](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html) then generating a pkg-config file from cmake using [configure_file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-master/command/configure_file.html). I'm not familiar with pkg-config myself, but would happily review a PR adding this functionality.
