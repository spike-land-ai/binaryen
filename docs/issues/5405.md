# #5405: Path variable to add in Windows

## Description

I need help in adding the right path to the environment variable on windows. I have downloaded the [Windows release](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases). I've added this `"C:\Users\kirti\Downloads\binaryen-version_111-x86_64-windows\binaryen-version_111\bin\wasm-opt.exe"` path to system environment variables, but I still get the error while running my `cargo contract`

I can confirm this is still an issue in 2024:

1. `npm install wasm-opt -g`
2. `wasm-opt --version`
3. `wasm-opt not found`

This isn't an issue with the npm pkg, but it's like you folks are checking absolute paths, for some reason, instead of PATH?

Does this work if you put binaryen-version_111/bin in your path rather than the path the executable itself? If not, this seems like a bug with `cargo contract` rather than Binaryen.
