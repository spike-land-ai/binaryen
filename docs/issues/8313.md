# #8313: Missing fp16 type validation

## Description

It looks like e.g. the validator does not look inside `SIMDTernary` for e.g. `RelaxedNmaddVecF16x8` and require the fp16 feature. That causes the fuzzer to not realize a testcase depends on that feature. In particular, that means that on ClusterFuzz we are sometimes using fp16 without wanting to, which makes those testcases fail in V8 unhelpfully, with errors like
```
CompileError: WebAssembly.Module(): Compiling function #33 failed: invalid simd opcode: 0xfd14f, enable with --experimental-wasm-fp16 @+3171
```
ClusterFuzz ignores those silently. Our local fuzzer errors on this, though rarely, so this is not urgent to fix, but it would be good to. Or is V8 ready for fp16 fuzzing perhaps? cc @brendandahl

The V8 folks want to wait on fuzzing FP16 for now.  I can look into fixing for our fuzzer though.
