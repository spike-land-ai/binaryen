## Description

See FIXMEs introduced in: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/2125

Essentially, the check for `calls == 1` need to be moved first in that function, otherwise `oneCallerInlineMaxSize` can never be bigger than `flexibleInlineMaxSize`, which naturally it would make sense for it to be.

@kripken mentioned this change can only be made after it has been checked if it doesn't regress size/speed.
