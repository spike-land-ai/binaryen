## Description

Currently the tests fail when BIGINT is enabled:
https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/actions/runs/12406958589/job/34636211812?pr=7161

Emscripten enables WASM_BIGINT by default now and the feature is very widely supported, so if there is a benefit to enabling it, then we should fix the Binaryen bindings.
