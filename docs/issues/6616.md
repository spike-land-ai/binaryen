## Description

The [branch hinting](https://github.com/WebAssembly/branch-hinting/blob/main/proposals/branch-hinting/Overview.md#design) proposal is close to reaching phase 4. Its text format depends on the annotations proposal, and since the new wat parser supports annotations in general, it will now be easier to implement support for branch hinting. This should probably be combined with adding support for branch hinting in the LLVM WebAssembly backend to be most useful.
