## Description

On Windows it seems the DLL is built, but no corresponding import library (LIB).

Edit: Should add the DLL seems to be installed into `CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` instead of `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.

None of the maintainers use Windows regularly, but PRs improving our support would be welcome.
