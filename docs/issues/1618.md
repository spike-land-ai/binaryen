## Description

The tracing option in the C API makes it easy to create testcases from code using the C API. It's come up that printing to a file might be better than stdout which is what we currently do. Background: https://github.com/tweag/asterius/issues/22#issuecomment-403305157

For simplicity maybe we can just change the API and make `BinaryenSetAPITracing` receive a filename (and if people want stdout, they can pass in `/dev/stdout`).
