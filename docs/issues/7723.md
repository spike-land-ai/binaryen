## Description

I have wasm code that is set up in such a way that I know if a deferred function is called, the module containing it will already have been loaded. Since the code is naturally set up to ensure functions are called in the right order, it would be nice to turn off the indirection/placeholders that `wasm-split` introduces. Or at least shrink these as much as possible to minimize their impact on code size.

Would `--no-placeholders` meet you needs? Or do you mean something else?
