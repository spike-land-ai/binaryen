## Description

I haven't seen anything on this and was curious if anyone has attempted this or thought into this.


Currently, bindings to binaryen are exposed via the `c` and `js` api's, which both require separate maintenance. I know there have been some issues keeping the js api up to date in the past, and recently, the embind work, which aims to autogenerate the js api.

I am curious if anyone has taken a look at generating or creating a `wit` component interface for binaryen and then using the component in the current component model tooling to generate bindings for a language, as it would make binaryen extremely portable. Component model is still an early days proposal though, so I'm not sure if this would make sense to do now.
