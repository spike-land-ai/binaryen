## Description

If we could automatically run wasm-reduce on a failing testcase that might save a bunch of time. it would need to be specific for each TestcaseHandler, though, so basically a `.reduce()` method that if it exists we could call it. Then the output of the fuzzer finding a failing testcase could also include the reduced testcase.

Also reducing the command itself could be useful (getting rid of unnecessary passes, etc.).

Mostly fixed in #2232 which added the core capability and implemented it in one of the testcase handlers. Remaining work is to rewrite the others as well.
