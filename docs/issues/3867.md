## Description

It is understandable that `--duplicate-function-elimination` removes debug info, as that isn't updated correctly. But does it need to remove the `names` section as well?

I think that is separate, but perhaps confusing. You need to pass in `-g` to preserve the names section, otherwise it is stripped out by `wasm-opt` by default.

Duplicate function elimination should work with the names section, except that it has to pick a single name for the merged function, and what it picks is one of the original names at "random".
