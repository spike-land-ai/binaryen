## Description

@kripken suggested creating a list of PRs [here](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/pull/4265#issuecomment-951283160), sorted in order of priority (the most important first):

 - #4272
 - #4307
 - #4282
 - #4145
 - #4291
 - #4266
 - #4249
 
 I think that's enough for now. I then plan to review and update older PRs
