## Description

Similar to known maximum bits `getMaxBits` for integers we could track sign for floats. It's quite useful and deterministic (except NaN ofc). This will allow you to do more optimizations for floating points. For example `x + 0` -> `x` if we know `x` never has sign bits so `-0` is not possible. LLVM already do this:

Also `f64.sqrt(x)` -> `sNaN` if we know `hasSignBit(x) == 1` and etc
